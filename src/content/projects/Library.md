**Use Case Library** is a custom WordPress plugin developed during my academic exchange at **Windesheim University** in the Netherlands. This project was a collaborative effort within an international team of four—consisting of two Dutch students, one French peer, and myself—working directly for our client, **Rob Van De Star**. Together, we designed and implemented a professional solution to manage and showcase technical use cases for the Windesheim Technology Radar.

Developed as a full-stack WordPress solution, the plugin leverages a custom **MySQL database schema** to store and retrieve complex project data efficiently. The project highlights my ability to bridge client requirements with robust technical implementation in a multicultural environment.

The plugin provides a complete ecosystem for use case management, featuring:

* **Dynamic Library Display**: A user-friendly interface powered by **AJAX** to provide a seamless browsing experience. It includes advanced filtering systems that allow visitors to sort projects by **Innovation Sectors**, **Value Chain stages**, **Themes**, and **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.
* **Integrated Submission System**: A custom front-end form that enables users to submit new project data. This system features robust **PHP validation**, secure **image upload handling**, and a custom **REST API endpoint** to process submissions without reloading the page.
* **Automated Workflow**: To streamline communication, the plugin includes a dedicated mailer system that sends automated confirmations to contributors and notification alerts to administrators upon new submissions.
* **Bespoke Admin Dashboard**: A centralized management area built specifically for the client's workflow. It features a paginated and sortable list of all submissions, allowing administrators to review, edit, and publish use cases with a single click.
