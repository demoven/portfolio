**Astro Portfolio** is a high-performance personal website designed to serve as a comprehensive showcase of my professional journey and technical expertise. Built with the **Astro** framework, this project utilizes a modern component-based architecture to deliver a lightning-fast user experience with optimal SEO. 

I developed this platform with the primary objective of supporting my internship applications, creating a centralized space to present my CV and detailed project case studies in a professional and accessible manner. To achieve a high level of technical refinement, the development process was deeply integrated with advanced AI assistance, leveraging **Gemini**, **Google AntiGravity**, and **Claude 4.5 Sonnet** (via the AntiGravity environment). 

These AI tools were instrumental in architecting the site’s structure, implementing responsive designs with **Tailwind CSS**, and managing content efficiently through Markdown and TypeScript. This project not only showcases my proficiency in modern web development but also demonstrates my ability to effectively harness cutting-edge artificial intelligence to build sophisticated, production-ready digital products.
