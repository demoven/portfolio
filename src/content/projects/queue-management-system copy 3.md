This project involved the design and development of a real-time queue management system for public services. Built with a microservices architecture, it aimed to significantly reduce user wait times and streamline appointment scheduling. The frontend was developed using **Angular** for a dynamic user experience, while the backend leveraged **Node.js** with **MongoDB** to handle real-time data processing and API integrations. A key feature was the integration with the "Publik" API for seamless data synchronization.
