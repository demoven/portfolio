**Culibox** is a modern Android application designed to streamline the culinary experience through an intuitive, hands-free interface. Built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** following Material Design 3 guidelines, the app allows users to create, organize, and manage a personal library of recipes synchronized in real-time via **Firebase**. The project's standout feature is its specialized **Cooking Mode**, which leverages advanced **Voice Recognition** to enable a touchless kitchen experience. By using French voice commands like "Suivant" (Next) or "Ingrédient", users can navigate through step-by-step instructions without ever needing to touch their screen with messy hands, solving a common pain point for home cooks. This project showcases a robust **MVVM architecture**, efficient state management with Coroutines and Flow, and a focus on accessibility and user-centered design.
